# data-scrapping-using-java
data scrapping of top 250 movies of imdb including its name, rating and link using java and storing all the data in the database according to their respective attributes


How to run the program----
1. First of all add the 2 external libraries i have uploaded to your eclipse or u can simply download it from other source. They are jsoup library and mysql connector library.
2. Second load the datascrap.sql file and then open the table. U will find the data which i had scrapped.
3. U can run the java program and u'll get the same data in your database and in case, the data at site changes in any aspect then the following changes will be reflected in the database once u will run the java program.


Hope u guys will find it interesting..
